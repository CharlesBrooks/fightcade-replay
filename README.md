# fightcade-replay

Plans for #fightcade-replay
1. Rust app using winapi to automatically record fightcade games
2. Setup shortcuts for the user to "clip" rounds
3. setup configuration to allow users to save games to different directories


Basically I don't really know what im doing, so im trying to scrap something together to get to a point where i can find a fightcade game window, and record it to a file.

Ideally I'll figure out how to write x amount of video to a clips file for a given user.

Baby steps :
1. Always find a 3rd Strike window for now since 3rd Strike is the best fighting game of all time.
2. Maybe figure out a way to screenshot the 3rd strike first, then work on trying to do a video.
